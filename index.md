I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Communication at American University in Washington D.C., see my [faculty page](https://www.american.edu/soc/faculty/menchent.cfm). My research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of political communication and digital media studies, with a focus on methodology. I am the author of a digital research tool called Web Historian, and I write about trace data methodology, and political information consumption in the digital media era. I teach courses in research methods and an introduction to media studies.
