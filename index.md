## Welcome!

I am a research consultant working with clients to design and implement innovative computational methods. I am based in the Chicago area and I work with clients around the world. I am the author of a digital research tool called [Web Historian](http:/www.webhistorian.org), and I write about trace data methodology, and political information consumption in the digital media era. I have taught courses and workshops in research methods, including introductory programming, and data analysis.
