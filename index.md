## Welcome!

My research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of political communication and digital media studies, with a focus on methodology. I am the author of a digital research tool called [Web Historian](http:/www.webhistorian.org), and I write about trace data methodology, and political information consumption in the digital media era. I primarily teach courses in research methods, communication theory, and introductory programming and data analysis.
